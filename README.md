# 🛡️ Cybersecurity & Systems Engineering Portfolio
### Paul Leone | Aspiring Security Analyst & Infrastructure Engineer

Welcome to my professional development repository. This space serves as a comprehensive showcase of my journey into the cybersecurity field, documenting the technical labs, security frameworks, and automation workflows I have built to defend modern infrastructure. 

My focus is on bridging the gap between **IT Operations (SysAdmin)** and **Security Operations (Blue Teaming)**. Through these projects, I demonstrate a commitment to continuous learning, a "security-by-design" mindset, and the technical proficiency required to mitigate risks in enterprise environments.

## Security Homelab & Technical Labs
*Deep-dive technical implementations of defensive and offensive security controls.*

### Network Security & Perimeter Defense
* **[Advanced Network Security Deployment](https://github.com/your-username/linkTBD)**: Configured **pfSense/OPNsense** firewalls with multi-zone segmentation (VLANs), granular ACLs, and encrypted tunnels (TLS/SSL, SSH).
* **[IDS/IPS & WAF Implementation](https://github.com/your-username/linkTBD)**: Deployed **Suricata** and **Snort** for deep packet inspection and **SafeLine WAF** for application-layer protection.

### Identity & Access Management (IAM)
* **[Enterprise PKI & Secrets Management](https://github.com/your-username/linkTBD)**: Built a multi-tier PKI featuring an **offline OpenSSL Root CA** and an automated **StepCA Intermediate CA** using ACME protocol.
* **[Unified Identity Services](https://github.com/your-username/linkTBD)**: Integrated **Active Directory** (Windows) and **Authentik** (web services) as centralized IdPs, secured via **Traefik** reverse proxy. 

### Automation & Infrastructure as Code
* **[IaC & Workflow Orchestration](https://github.com/your-username/linkTBD)**: Automated infrastructure provisioning using **Terraform** and **Ansible**.
* Python, PowerShell and Bash scripting for various automation use cases. 
* **[SOAR Automation](https://github.com/your-username/linkTBD)**: Streamlined incident response by building automated workflows in **n8n** and **Shuffle** to reduce Mean Time to Respond (MTTR).

### SOC Operations & Endpoint Security
* **[Managed SOC Deployment](https://github.com/your-username/linkTBD)**: Integrated **Wazuh (XDR)**, **ELK** and **Splunk (SIEM)** for centralized logging and alerting across Windows, Linux, and MacOS endpoints.
* **[Incident Response Pipeline](https://github.com/your-username/linkTBD)**: Connected **theHive**, **Cortex**, and **MISP** to automate IoC enrichment via **VirusTotal** and **Shodan** APIs.

### Observability & Monitoring
* **[Full-Stack Monitoring Suite](https://github.com/your-username/linkTBD)**: Established real-time visibility using **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **Pulse** and **Checkmk**.
* **[Automated Alerting & Patching](https://github.com/your-username/linkTBD)**: Configured automated patch management (PatchMon amd WUD) and instant security notifications via **Discord Webhooks** and hosted SMTP relay.
